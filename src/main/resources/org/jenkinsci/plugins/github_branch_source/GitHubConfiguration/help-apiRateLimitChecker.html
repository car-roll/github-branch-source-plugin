        <b>Throttle For Normalize</b>: Attempt to evenly distribute GitHub API requests. This strategy can be helpful when there are numerous pipelines
        that are managed by multiple users and/or there are many concurrent builds, making it difficult to know when a pipeline has been paused
        due to exceeding the GitHub API usage limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Throttle On Over</b>: Restrict GitHub API requests only when near or above rate limit. This strategy may be preferred over "Throttle for Normalize"
        if there are relatively few/infrequent queries to the GitHub API.
